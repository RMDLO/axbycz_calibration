/*
DESCRIPTION:

Note that the std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon() method provides 
the smallest possible difference that can be detected between 
two floating-point numbers, which can be used as the default 
value for the thresh parameter. The implementation simply checks 
if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal 
to the threshold.

    double diff = std::abs(a - b);
